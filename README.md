# CS255-Projects

The DriverPass client desired a web based system that would allow their users to better their overall driving knowledge and skills in order to be prepared for their DMV license test. 
For the analysis and design documents I focused on making all of my diagrams clean and organized to make them easy to interpret and understand even for non technical staff. 
If I could revise one portion of this assignment I would include a DMV user on the use case diagram to depict the role they play in this system. 
To consider the users needs I put myself into their perspective of needing to attain my license and wanted to make it a streamlined process so the interaction with the site and scheduling appointments for behind the wheel training is simple for the user. 
I approached this design very much with an agile mindset, I started with an overall breakdown making a blueprint with my diagrams then incrementally started implementing what the system would need.
